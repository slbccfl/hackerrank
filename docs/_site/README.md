## Purpose:
This repository contains my efforts to use Eclipse and Java to resolve a suite of the coding exercises available on the HackerRank website. This effort was intended to develop my understanding and skills in Java coding and using Eclipse to develop this code. Adjunct to this I have endevored to employ TDD (Test Driven Development) in more advanced exercises and to leverage on Github-Pages and Javadoc to document the lessons I have learned during this overall effort.

## Principles:
1. My own code - While I have investigated solutions broadly, I have developed my own coding solutions for each of these exercises.
2. Use Standards - As I have developed these solutions I have sought to understand the standards used by the software industry and to employ those standards.
3. Code to Learn - In some cases I have employed data structures or approached problems in such a way as to give myself more of an opportunity to learn about Java functionality or problem solving methodologies.
