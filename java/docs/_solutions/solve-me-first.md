## Solution:
What is interesting about this problem is that it is presented as the one to solve first among the HackerRank exercises and might be indicative of the total number of individuals submitting solutions on the HackerRank website. At the time of this writing the number of submissions to this problem was just over 878,000, though not all of them successful. I find it interesting to compared this number to the number of submissions and successful submissions to other problems.
