## Solution: 
This is a dynamic programming problem that requires the use of memoization to be efficient enough to pass all test cases.
### Strategy:
Collected and stored the sequences of integers in a List<Integer> data structure. Used a recursive "lcs" method to find the common sequence of integers. This method returns a string with the integers separated by blanks.
